#  Uber Fares Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on exploring Uber trip fare data using Python and Power BI. 
The goal was to uncover patterns related to pricing, trip timing, and ride behavior, 
then present those findings through an interactive dashboard and structured report.
## Project Overview

As part of the coursework INSY 8413: Introduction to Big Data Analytics, this assignment involved:
- Cleaning and preparing real-world Uber data
- Creating time and location-based features
- Analyzing trends using Python
- Designing a dashboard in Power BI
- Reporting insights and conclusions

## Data Preparation

Python was used to:
- Remove missing and invalid values
- Filter out extreme outliers
- Format date and time columns
- Generate new features:
