#  Uber Fares Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on exploring Uber trip fare data using Python and Power BI. 
The goal was to uncover patterns related to pricing, trip timing, and ride behavior, 
then present those findings through an interactive dashboard and structured report.
## Project Overview

As part of the coursework INSY 8413: Introduction to Big Data Analytics, this assignment involved:
- Cleaning and preparing real-world Uber data
- Creating time and location-based features
- Analyzing trends using Python
- Designing a dashboard in Power BI
- Reporting insights and conclusions

## Data Preparation

Python was used to:
- Remove missing and invalid values
- Filter out extreme outliers
- Format date and time columns
- Generate new features:
  - Hour of the day
  - Day of week

The dashboard helps users:
- View fare trends across hours, days, and months
- Explore trip distances and pricing relationships
- Identify peak hours and high-demand days
- See where most rides originate on a map
- Geographically knowing how data are analysed.
