 Report About Uber Fares Dataset Analysis
 Introduction
This project involved analyzing Uber fare data using Python and Power BI to extract meaningful insights about ride behavior, pricing patterns, and location trends.
The goal was to clean and prepare the dataset, engineer new analytical features, and visualize key metrics through an interactive dashboard.
The work was carried out as part of the coursework for INSY 8413: Introduction to Big Data Analytics.

Methodology
1. Data Collection
The dataset was sourced from Kaggleâ€™s Uber Fares Dataset, which includes fare amounts, pickup and drop-off coordinates, timestamps, and passenger count.

2. Data Cleaning (Python)
Using Python (Pandas, NumPy), the dataset underwent several preprocessing steps:

Removed missing and null values

Filtered unrealistic fare amounts and negative passenger counts

Restricted latitude and longitude to the NYC area

Converted pickup time to datetime format

3. Feature Engineering
New columns were added to support time-based and spatial analysis:

Hour, Day, Month, and Day of Week from pickup_datetime

Distance (in kilometers) using the Haversine formula

Peak vs. Off-Peak Indicator for rush-hour analysis

Two datasets were exported:

uber_cleaned.csv: Base cleaned data

uber_enhanced.csv: Includes all additional features, used in Power BI

4. Data Visualization (Power BI)
The enhanced dataset was loaded into Power BI to create an interactive dashboard with the following key visuals:

Histogram of Fare Amounts: Shows most trips cost between $5â€“$15

Fare vs Distance (Scatter Plot): Reveals that longer distances result in higher fares

Trips by Hour: Displays peak activity in early morning and evening

Trips by Day of Week: Fridays and Saturdays see the highest volume

Map of Pickup Locations: Most pickups happen around central NYC and major transport hubs

Slicers and Filters: Allow users to filter by hour, weekday, fare range, and peak hours
##Analysis
1. Fare Distribution
Most trips are short and cost less than $20

A small number of trips show extremely high fares â€” identified as outliers

2. Distance Relationship
Fare and distance have a strong positive correlation

Some anomalies exist (high fares for short trips), likely due to traffic or minimum fare policies

3. Temporal Patterns
Peak Hours: 7â€“9 AM and 5â€“7 PM

Weekday vs Weekend: Weekends show a slight increase in longer trips and higher fares

Seasonality: Monthly data shows fluctuations, which could align with tourism and events (subject to extended data)

4. Geographic Analysis
Dense pickup zones in Manhattan, JFK Airport, and downtown areas

Less activity in outer boroughs and suburbs

Key Metric	Observation
Most common fare range	$5 â€“ $15
Strongest correlation	Fare vs Distance
Busiest days	Friday and Saturday
Peak ride hours	7â€“9 AM and 5â€“7 PM
Most active pickup zones	Manhattan, JFK Airport, and tourist hotspots
Fare outliers	Detected and removed during data cleaning

As Conclusion
The Uber Fares dataset provides valuable insights into user behavior, pricing trends, and ride demand. By combining Pythonâ€™s data processing power with Power BIâ€™s visualization tools, we successfully built a flexible and informative dashboard. This setup allows business stakeholders to interact with the data and make informed decisions.

Based on the analysis:
I would recommend to :
Driver Allocation: Increase availability in central NYC during peak hours

Surge Pricing: Adjust dynamically based on hour and weekday

Marketing Focus: Promote off-peak ride discounts to balance demand

Outlier Monitoring: Flag and review fares significantly higher than average
